# Iris Classification

This project demonstrates the classification of Iris flowers using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. The code is written in Python and uses the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks.

The Iris dataset is a popular benchmark dataset in machine learning, consisting of measurements of iris flowers from three different species. The goal is to train a model that can accurately predict the species of an iris based on its measurements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone: https://github.com/saadarazzaq/iris-classification.git
cd iris-classification


2. Install the required Python packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


### Usage

1. Prepare the data:

- Ensure that you have the Iris dataset file (`Iris.csv`) in the same directory as the code.

2. Run the code:

I have attached Google Colab Notebook Link Herewith the project

The code will load the dataset, preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, train a Random Forest Classifier model, make predictions on the test set, and display the accuracy of the model.

3. View the confusion matrix:

After running the code, a confusion matrix will be displayed, providing insights into the model's performance. The confusion matrix shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class, visualized as a heatmap.

## Results

The accuracy of the model on the Iris classification task will be displayed as a percentage. Additionally, the confusion matrix visualization will help evaluate the model's performance in predicting the species of the Iris flowers.
